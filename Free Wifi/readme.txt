Parker File Updates:




Free%20Wifi.html

non structural changes -- I changes doctype because the strict version you were using threw and error on my machine and that solved it.

I wouldn't worry about that too much.



showOff_Script.js

this is quite different -- new ways to track update rates etc -- three variables not one and a single file for writing and storing the number of pics.

you will want to uncomment the line that hides the debug element in the $.ready() function.



pictureCount.txt

a new TXT file put it on server


photoDisplay.php

no major changes


upload_file.php

this has a new structure in terms of recording new images.


upload.html

I don't think this change -- just confirm name of server PHP script that is called on your system.


setuploadTOZero.php
this is no longer used.



It may be possible to print with only processing -- but I don't know yet -- will keep you posted.
